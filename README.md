# MPC-MPG-PROJECT
## The repository contains only the necessary files used during the creation of the project. Files generated by VS2022 are not included here. Special thanks to the game studio BattleState Games for allowing me to "borrow" the vodka model and textures from their game Escape from Tarkov.

# Requirements and Points
1. Object modeling – character, body parts, clouds, sun, fractal trees, vodka model – 3 points  
2. Animation – pressing F3 or selecting "Toggle Object Rotation" in the menu spins the scene. Pressing F4 creates a "3D" tree effect using billboarding (menu option "Toggle Tree Billboarding"). – 1 point  
3. Lighting – can be toggled with the F7 key or via the "Toggle Lighting" menu option. – 1 point  
4. Free movement on a horizontal plane – movement with arrow keys; camera smoothly responds to mouse movement without any clicks. – 1 point  
5. Menu – menu contains more than 5 items, including dropdown windows. – 2 points  
6. Text output – top-left corner shows the last executed command, top-right corner displays a debug menu. Not affected by transformations, lighting, etc. – 2 points  
7. Blender model – successfully "borrowed"; Blender was used to create the model. The model has a correct texture. – 1 + 1 point  
8. Flying – basic camera movement includes flying. Movement is limited to prevent acrobatics like flips or rolls. Flying can be disabled with F2 or via "Toggle Headbobbing" menu to switch to walking. – 2 points  
9. Ascending/Descending – can be done using PGUP and PGDOWN keys, movement is limited (e.g., you can't go below the map). – 1 point  
10. Step simulation – can be toggled with F2 or via "Toggle Headbobbing" in the menu. Simulates realistic walking motion. – 1 + 1 point  
11. Buttons – bottom-right corner has a clickable button to refill stamina. – 2 points  
12. Transparency – the character (ghost) in the center of the scene is transparent, as are the outer parts of the clouds. – 1 point  
13. Impassable object – the character (ghost) in the center of the scene is not passable. – 2 points  
14. Texturing – Blender model has a texture, the floor has an external texture, the character's head has a texture generated by code, Bézier surfaces have generated textures. – 2 points  
15. Bézier surfaces – hills around the scene are made with Bézier surfaces; this can be verified by flying under the map. – 2 points  
16. Custom extension – for the purpose of the button on the bottom-right of the screen and restricted movement. Can be triggered with F6 or the "Refill Stamina" menu option. – ??? points

# Total Points
26 points. I guess more than 24 isn’t possible, but if it were, I wouldn’t complain :^)
